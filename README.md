# Hello there.

Welcome to my GitHub profile. It doesn't have every project I've worked on just yet (there's plenty that I still need to upload), but it has a lot of the current stuff.

**Things I'm learning right now:**
 - Yocto embedded linux
 - STM32 ARM processors and boards
 - Svelte + SvelteKit + Svelte Native
 - Tailwind CSS
